    <h1>Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Clickergame! I finally decided to add a guide after showing my dad how to access this website, so here it is!</p>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>To start making money, press the "Work" button. This makes you 5 dollars, and it absolutely free to do! After making some money from working, you should go buy something to make money for you! I would recommend buying a generator since that is pretty cheap.
    <h2>Rolling in cash</h2>
    <p>After buying any money making items, you might notice that you aren't making any income instantly. Don't worry! Press the "Collect Profits" button to automatically generate income. This button is in place since I can't figure out how to update stuff automatically, and it makes it so you still have to click after buying items!</p>
